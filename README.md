# oitCodeChallenge

Hey! My name is Tanner Atkin and this is my submission for the code challenge. I honestly loved doing it and thought that it was a really fun way to test my skills. If the code in this repo doesn't work for some reason I have a link below to a copy of the notebook, let me know if you have any questions or if I need to provide anything else.

This project took me about an hour to an hour and a half to complete.

Thank you and I look forward to hearing from you!
